# Rancid Tomatillos 

## Overview of project and goals: 
   - This project is designed to allow someone to see a grid of different movie posters with their popularity vote count displayed underneath the poster. There are up and down arrows on either side of the vote count that will increase or decrese the vote count based on which arrow you input. 
   
   - A user is able to see a specific movie's details when they click on the movie poster. This takes them to a new page with the movie id allowing them to use the back arrow to go back to the home page. There is also a Home Button that appears once you open a movies deatils that, when clicked, will navigate you back to the home page as well.  

   - We also made sure that when a user tries to naviagte to a page that does not exist, or to a movie id that does not exist, there is a gentle message letting them know of why there is nothing being being displayed. 

## Overview of technologies used
   - We used GitHub, GitHub Projects, Slack, Cypress, Router and React
   - We also used Turings Rancid Tomatillo Heroku API to retrieve movie posters, vote counts, and movie details.

## Challeneges, Wins and any other reflections
   - As a win we both feel that we worked very well together as a pair and were able to deligate tasks efficiently and in an organized manner. 
   - This project seemed to be broken down in a way that was very understandable and allowed for a good learning and understanding of the concepts that we are currently being taught. 

   - Challenges: 
      - Logan: Honestly one of the largest challange I faced on this project was just an issue of syntax and typos such as accidentally having a `-` in front of an `=` or other annoyances.
