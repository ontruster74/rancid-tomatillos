# Rancid Tomatillos 

## Overview of project and goals: 
   - This project allows the user to see a grid of various movie posters, with their popularity vote count displayed underneath each poster image. There are up and down arrows on either side of the vote count that will increase or decrease the votes based on which one the user clicks. 
   
   - A user is able to see a specific movie's details when they click on the movie poster. This takes them to a new page, with the movie id allowing them to use the back arrow to go back to the home page. There is also a Home Button that appears once you open a movies deatils that, when clicked, will navigate you back to the home page.  

   - We also made sure that when a user tries to naviagte to a page that does not exist, or to a movie id that does not exist, there is a gentle message letting them know the information they want cannot be found. 

## Overview of technologies used
   - We used GitHub, GitHub Projects, Slack, Cypress, Router and React in our tech stack.
   - We also used Turing's Rancid Tomatillos Heroku API to retrieve movie posters, vote counts, and movie details.

## Challeneges, Wins and any other reflections
   - As a win, we both feel that we worked very well together as a pair, and were able to deligate tasks efficiently and in an organized manner. 
   - This project was broken down in a very understandable format, and allowed for easy learning of the concepts involved. 

   - Challenges: 
      - Logan: Honestly one of the largest challange I faced on this project was just an issue of syntax and typos such as accidentally having a `-` in front of an `=` or other annoyances. 
      - Rig: I found it diffiult to keep track of all the myriad details needed in order to meet the project's evaluation requirements, but out Projects board helped with that immensely.
